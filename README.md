# Parking Lot Management System

### Overview 
Finding a parking space can be a challenging and time-consuming task. The PARKING LOT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM simplifies this process by providing a user-friendly web platform that displays real-time parking spot availability. Drivers can check which spots are available (indicated in green) or occupied (indicated in red) before arriving. This saves time, reduces frustration, and minimizes traffic congestion. The system is designed to enhance user experience with its simple and efficient interface.
